The iCiteR package is a minimal R package designed to help users retrieve data from the NIH's [iCite API](https://icite.od.nih.gov/api). This includes the relative citation ratio, which you can read about [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541).

## Installation

iCiteR is on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) and can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("iCiteR")
```

Or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("riddlet/iCiteR")
```
## Example

There is just one function that will be of interest to most users: `get_metrics`. This function takes as input a a vector of pubmed IDs and returns all the information yielded by the iCite API.

Likely, most users will already have the PMIDs that correspond to the articles for which they wish to obtain data. For a given article in pubmed, the ID is also printed on the page

![The PMID for the Relative Citation Rate paper on Pubmed](vignettes/RCR_PMID.jpg)

For a given PMID(s), one can get the relative citation rate and all other data returned by the iCite API as follows

```{r example1}
library(iCiteR)
get_metrics('27599104')
```

The function also takes a vector of PMIDS:

```{r exampl2}
get_metrics(c('27599104', '27830815', '28968388', '28968381'))
```

If you would rather not have the results in a dataframe, it is possible to obtain an S3 object for the data by using the `icite_api` function

```{r example3}
dat <- icite_api('27599104')

print(dat)
```

If you are having trouble accessing the data for a particular PMID, the `icite_api` function will also return somewhat more informative error messages (development version only):

```{r example4, error=TRUE}
icite_api('42')
```

It is worth noting that the iCite database presently goes back to 1995. Earlier papers will not have any data associated with them. Also, recent papers may not be available. See https://icite.od.nih.gov/stats and https://icite.od.nih.gov/help for details of the iCite system that this package works with.
